# Port Management Guidelines

## Port Assignments
- Main Website (Vite React): Port 3000
- iCal Proxy Server: Port 3001

## Port Conflict Resolution
When encountering a port conflict:

1. ALWAYS check which process is using the required port:
```bash
lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
```

2. If the port is in use by a previous instance of our service:
   - Kill the existing process
   - Restart the service on the same port
   - DO NOT try alternative ports

3. NEVER use alternative ports (3002, 3003, etc.) as this breaks the architecture
   - Main website MUST run on 3000
   - iCal proxy MUST run on 3001

## Standard Port Resolution Commands
```bash
# Check port usage
lsof -i :3000  # For main website
lsof -i :3001  # For iCal proxy

# Kill process using port (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill PID

# Restart services on correct ports
cd website-lovable-shift && npm run dev -- --port 3000
cd ical-proxy-server && node server.js  # Runs on 3001
```

## Important Notes
- Port assignments are critical for service discovery
- Changing ports can break inter-service communication
- Always maintain the standard port configuration
