# Service Verification System Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. Verification Test Script
**File**: `service-verification-tests.sh`

A comprehensive bash script that automatically tests:
- Main website service on port 3000
- Admin gallery page accessibility
- iCal proxy server on port 3001
- Gallery API endpoints
- Optional build verification

**Usage**:
```bash
# Basic tests
./service-verification-tests.sh

# Include build verification
./service-verification-tests.sh --build
```

### 2. Updated Documentation

#### Port Management Guidelines (`.cursor/rules/Port Management.mdc`)
Added:
- Service verification requirements after restart
- Reference to test script
- Common issues and solutions
- Build verification steps

#### CURSOR Usage Standards (`.cursor/rules/CURSOR USAGE STANDARDS – READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING CODE.mdc`)
Added:
- Section 9: TEST AND VERIFY — NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL IT'S TESTED
- Requirement to run build tests after changes
- Requirement to run verification after service restart

#### Development Guide (`website-lovable-shift/DEVELOPMENT.md`)
Added:
- Service Verification section
- Manual verification checklist
- Common build/runtime issues
- Import/export troubleshooting

## Test Results

Current service status:
- ✅ Main website service running on port 3000
- ✅ HTML page loads correctly
- ⚠️ React components might not be rendering (check browser)
- ✅ JavaScript modules being served
- ✅ Admin page accessible
- ✅ iCal proxy running on port 3001
- ✅ All API endpoints responding

## Next Steps

1. Fix React rendering issue by checking browser console
2. Run `npm run build` to verify no TypeScript errors
3. Use the test script after any service restart
4. Keep verification tests updated as new features are added
